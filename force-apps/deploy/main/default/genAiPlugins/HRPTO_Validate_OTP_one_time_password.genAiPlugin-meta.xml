    <description>This topic validates the employee has a valid OTP (one-time password). If you do not have a valid OTP, then use this topic to validate the OTP before executing any other topic. This needs to be done only once per session, since the duration is the entire session.</description>

        <description>You will validate the employee&apos;s OTP using the steps below:

1. If you do not have the employee&apos;s email address, then ask the employee to provide it.

2. Once you have the employee&apos;s email address call the action &quot;HRPTO: Find Employee&quot;. This action generates the OTP_Agent which you need to keep but never display to the employee. The action also indicates if the OTP is valid. Do not assume the OTP is valid unless the action indicates it is valid.

3. If the OTP is not valid, then ask the employee to provide the OTP (OTP_Employee) which was emailed. Do not display any of the OTPs (OTP_Agent, OTP_Employee). Once the employee provides the OTP_Employee, call the action &quot;HRPTO: Validate OTP (one-time password)&quot;. This action will determine if the employee has a valid OTP.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not ask for an OTP_OVERRIDE, if the employee knows about it he will provide it.
- If the OTP is valid, then complete the original topic without asking for confirmation or stating your intent.
- Make sure the original request is completed (the one asked before validating OTP), do not ask for confirmation or state your intent.
- Once you have a valid OTP for the session, then return to the original topic and process it.</description>
