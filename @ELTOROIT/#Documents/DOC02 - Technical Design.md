# Technical Design

# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for the Dreamhouse Agent project. It provides detailed specifications for the development team to implement the functionalities described in the Project Kickoff Document.

# 2. System Architecture

The Dreamhouse Agent will be built on the Salesforce Platform, leveraging Agentforce, Data Cloud RAG, and external APIs. The architecture comprises the following key components:

## 2.1. Salesforce Agentforce:

- Agent definition and dialog management
- Orchestration of agent workflows

## 2.2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Engine:

- Leverage Salesforce Data Cloud and Einstein Data Libraries for RAG functionality with PDF files
- RAG will be processing the file titled "Dreamhouse Property Listing Guidelines & General Terms"

## 2.3. API Integration Layer:

- Connectivity to external APIs (walk score)

## 2.4. Internal User Interface:

- Salesforce Org

## 2.5. External User Interface:

- Salesforce Experience Cloud

# 3. Data Model

## 3.1. Salesforce Objects

- `Property__c`: Stores property details (address, price, features, etc.)
- `Broker__c`: Stores realtor information
- `Contact`: Stores client information (name, contact details, preferences, etc.)
- `Opportunity`: Tracks sales opportunities
- `Case`: Manages client service cases

## 3.2. External Data

- Property maps: [https://leafletjs.com](https://leafletjs.com)
- Walk Score API: [https://www.walkscore.com](https://www.walkscore.com)
- Neighborhood information (schools, amenities, walk scores)

# 4. Component Design

## 4.1. RAG Engine

- Ingest PDF files into Data Cloud
- Configure Einstein Data Libraries to process and index the PDF data for RAG
- Use Prompt Templates to retrieve relevant information based on user queries

## 4.2. API Integration Layer

### 4.2.1. Component:

- Apex Classes, Flows, External Services, Named Credentials

### 4.2.2. Functionality:

- Encapsulate API calls to external services
- Handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing
- Implement robust error handling and rate limiting

### 4.2.3. Security:

- Use Salesforce Named Credentials for secure storage of API keys

## 4.3. Agent Development

### 4.3.1. Component:

- Salesforce Agentforce

### 4.3.2. Functionality:

- Define agent personas and dialog flows
- Integrate with the RAG Engine and API Integration Layer
- Handle user input and generate responses

### 4.3.3. Details:

- _Agent Configuration_: Define agent names, descriptions, and initial greetings
- _Dialog Flow Design_: Create dialog flows for each use case (e.g., property search, tour scheduling). Include comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms in the dialog flows
- _Handoff to Human Agents_: Configure Omni-Channel to route conversations to appropriate agents. Ensure context is passed to the human agent to provide a seamless user experience
- _Rich Media_: Incorporate images, videos, and interactive elements in agent responses to enhance user engagement

### 4.3.4. Technology:

- Salesforce Agentforce, Experience Cloud, Omni-Channel, Salesforce Flows

## 4.4. Internal User Interface

### 4.4.1. Component:

- Salesforce Org

### 4.4.2. Functionality:

- Enable users to interact with the agent from within the Salesforce org
- Display property information, client details, and notifications
- Support user input and agent responses

### 4.4.3. Technology:

- Salesforce Org, Einstein, Agentforce, Salesforce Flows

## 4.5. External User Interface

### 4.5.1. Component:

- Salesforce Experience Cloud

### 4.5.2. Functionality:

- Provide a portal for property search, tour scheduling
- Embed the agent for chat-based interactions
- Display property details, tour availability, and status updates

### 4.5.3. Technology:

- Salesforce Experience Cloud, Lightning Web Components

# 5. Security

## 5.1. Data Access Control:

- Use Salesforce sharing settings and field-level security to control access to data

## 5.2. API Security:

- Use Salesforce Named Credentials to securely store API keys
- Implement authentication and authorization for external APIs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## 5.3. Data Privacy:

- Comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Implement data masking for sensitive information
- Implement audit logging

# 6. Scalability and Performance

## 6.1. Asynchronous Processing:

- Use Salesforce Queues and Platform Events to handle long-running processes

## 6.2. Code Optimization:

- Follow Salesforce best practices for Apex and Flow development
- Optimize SOQL queries and avoid governor limits

## 6.3. Caching:

- Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance

# 7. Error Handling

## 7.1. Apex and Flow Error Handling:

- Implement try-catch blocks in Apex to handle exceptions
- Use fault paths in Flows to handle errors
- Log errors to Salesforce logs

## 7.2. API Error Handling:

- Handle API errors gracefully
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Provide informative error messages to the user

## 7.3. RAG Error Handling:

- Handle cases where the RAG engine fails to retrieve relevant information
- Provide fallback responses to the user

# 8. Testing

- Develop unit tests for Apex classes and Flows
- Develop tests for Agentforce agents
- Create integration tests for API integrations and component interactions
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders
