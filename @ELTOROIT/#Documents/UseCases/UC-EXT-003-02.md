**UC-EXT-003-02: Transparent Transaction Documentation**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-003-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with transparent transaction documentation capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes tracking and managing closing documents and facilitating seamless document upload and verification. The goal is to provide customers with easy access to important transaction documents and streamline the document management process.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Closing documents and relevant transaction documents must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database.
- Agentforce must be configured to provide access to these documents and support document upload and verification.
- Salesforce Experience Cloud must be set up to allow document uploads and display document information.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to access, upload, or manage transaction documents.
2.  The user can request access to specific closing documents or upload new documents.
3.  The Agentforce agent retrieves the requested documents from the Salesforce database and provides them to the user, or facilitates the user's document upload.
4.  If document verification is required, the Agentforce agent guides the user through the verification process.
5.  The user can track the status of uploaded documents and receive notifications regarding document verification.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Document Not Found:** If the requested document is not found, the agent informs the user and provides appropriate alternatives or instructions.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If a user attempts to access documents they are not authorized to view, the system denies access and provides an error message.
- **Upload Failed:** If a document upload fails, the agent informs the user and provides instructions for retrying the upload.
- **Verification Failed:** If document verification fails, the agent informs the user and provides further instructions or support.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **Document Access Errors:** Errors related to retrieving or providing access to documents are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Document Upload Errors:** Errors that occur during document uploads are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.
- **Verification Errors:** Errors that occur during document verification are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.
- **Security Errors:** Errors related to unauthorized access attempts or document security are logged and handled appropriately.
