**UC-EXT-001-01: Advanced Property Search and Matching**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-001-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with advanced property search and matching capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes multi-criteria property search (price, location, features) and AI-powered personalized property recommendations. The goal is to enable customers to efficiently find properties that meet their specific needs and preferences.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud .
- Property data, including details like address, price, features, and location, must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database, specifically within the `Property__c` object .
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the necessary data sources and Salesforce objects to facilitate property search and retrieval.
- If AI-powered recommendations are implemented, the necessary AI models and logic must be in place and integrated with Agentforce.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to initiate a property search .
2.  The user provides their search criteria, which may include price range, location, property type, number of bedrooms, and other features.
3.  The Agentforce agent processes the user's search criteria and retrieves matching properties from the Salesforce database .
4.  If AI-powered recommendations are enabled, the agent uses AI models to generate personalized property recommendations based on the user's preferences and search history.
5.  The Agentforce agent presents the search results and/or personalized recommendations to the user through the Experience Cloud interface .
6.  The user can view property details, photos, and other relevant information.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **No Matching Properties:** If no properties match the user's search criteria, the agent provides a message indicating that no results were found and suggests alternative search options.
- **Invalid Search Criteria:** If the user provides invalid search criteria (e.g., incorrect format, invalid values), the agent prompts the user to correct their input.
- **AI Recommendation Error:** If an error occurs during the AI recommendation process, the agent provides a fallback mechanism, such as displaying only search results.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving property data from Salesforce are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.
- **AI Model Errors:** If errors occur with the AI models, the agent should fail gracefully and log the errors.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for advanced property search and matching:

1.  "Show me houses for sale in downtown."
2.  "I'm looking for a 3-bedroom apartment under $500,000."
3.  "Find properties with a large backyard."
