# UC-EXT-001-01: Advanced Property Search and Matching

## Purpose:

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with advanced property search and matching capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes multi-criteria property search (price, location, features) and AI-powered personalized property recommendations. The goal is to enable customers to efficiently find properties that meet their specific needs and preferences.

## What can the agent do?

1.  **Process and Validate Search Request**:

    - Parse and Validate Search Criteria: Accurately extract and validate search parameters (price, location, features) from the user's utterance, prompting for correction if needed.

2.  **Retrieve and Filter Property Listings**:

    - Query and Filter Property Data: Construct and execute a SOQL query against the `Property__c` object, applying location, price, and feature filters.

3.  **Present Search Results**:

    - Sort Search Results: Sort and allow users to sort results based on relevance or specified criteria.
    - Handle No Results: Provide a clear message and alternative options if no properties match the search.
    - Provide Property Details: Display detailed property information.

4.  **Enhance Search Experience**:

    - Enable Property Filtering: Allow users to further refine search results.
    - Provide Additional Information: Offer details on nearby schools, commute times, recent listings, and matching preferences.
