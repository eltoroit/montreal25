**UC-EXT-002-02: Interactive Property Exploration**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-002-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with interactive property exploration capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes virtual tour capabilities, integrated communication with agents, and personalized property recommendation follow-ups. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing immersive property exploration and seamless interaction with agents.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Property data, including virtual tour links or capabilities, must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database.
- Agentforce must be configured to support virtual tours, facilitate communication with agents, and manage personalized follow-ups.
- Salesforce Experience Cloud must be set up to display virtual tours and enable chat-based interactions.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to explore properties.
2.  The user can access virtual tours of properties, if available.
3.  The user can initiate communication with a Dreamhouse agent through chat or other integrated communication channels.
4.  The Agentforce agent facilitates communication between the user and the agent.
5.  The system manages personalized property recommendation follow-ups, providing users with additional information or suggestions based on their interactions and preferences.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Virtual Tour Unavailable:** If a virtual tour is not available for a selected property, the agent informs the user and provides alternative exploration options (e.g., photos, videos).
- **Agent Unavailable:** If an agent is not immediately available for communication, the system provides alternative contact methods or informs the user of the agent's availability.
- **Follow-up Preferences:** Users may have preferences regarding the frequency and type of follow-up communications. The system should allow users to manage these preferences.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **Virtual Tour Errors:** Errors related to accessing or displaying virtual tours are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Communication Errors:** Errors that occur during communication with agents are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.
- **Follow-up Errors:** Errors related to managing or delivering personalized follow-ups are logged.
