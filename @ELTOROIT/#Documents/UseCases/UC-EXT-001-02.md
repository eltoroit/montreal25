**UC-EXT-001-02: Contextual Property Insights**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-001-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with contextual property insights through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes retrieving neighborhood information, accessing commute and location analytics, and providing walkability and amenity scores. The goal is to offer customers comprehensive information about the surrounding area to help them make informed decisions about properties.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Property data, including location information, must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database.
- The API Integration Layer must be configured to connect to external APIs, such as the Walk Score API, to retrieve neighborhood information, commute and location analytics, and walkability and amenity scores.
- Agentforce must be configured to interact with the API Integration Layer and present the retrieved information to the user.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to request contextual property insights.
2.  The user selects a specific property or location for which they want to retrieve information.
3.  The Agentforce agent utilizes the API Integration Layer to call external APIs (e.g., Walk Score API) and retrieve relevant neighborhood information, commute and location analytics, and walkability and amenity scores.
4.  The Agentforce agent processes the retrieved information and presents it to the user through the Experience Cloud interface.
5.  The user can view details about the neighborhood, commute times, location analytics, and walkability and amenity scores for the selected property or location.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **API Call Failure:** If an API call to an external service fails, the agent handles the error gracefully and informs the user that the requested information could not be retrieved.
- **No Information Available:** If the external API does not provide information for the requested location, the agent informs the user and suggests alternative information sources.
- **Partial Information:** If the external API provides only partial information, the agent informs the user and presents the available data.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **API Errors:** Errors returned by external APIs are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving data from external APIs are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for contextual property insights:

1.  "What is the walk score for this address?"
2.  "Show me the neighborhood information for this property."
3.  "What are the commute times from here to downtown?"
4.  "Tell me about the nearby amenities."
5.  "What are the schools in this area?"
6.  "Show me the location analytics for this neighborhood."
7.  "Is this area walkable?"
8.  "What are the grocery stores near this property?"
9.  "Show me the public transportation options."
10. "What are the restaurants in this neighborhood?"
11. "Tell me about the parks and recreation areas."
12. "What is the crime rate in this area?"
13. "Show me the demographics of this neighborhood."
14. "What are the entertainment options nearby?"
15. "Tell me about the community feel of this area."
16. "What are the average commute times to major employers?"
17. "Show me the nearby hospitals and healthcare facilities."
18. "What are the shopping options in this area?"
19. "Tell me about the local events and activities."
20. "What are the future development plans for this neighborhood?"
21. "Give me the details about the neighborhood."
22. "Show me the commute information for this location."

**Agentforce Topic:**

- **Topic Summary:** Contextual Property Insights
- **Topic Description:** This topic covers the functionality for external users to retrieve neighborhood information, access commute and location analytics, and obtain walkability and amenity scores. It provides users with comprehensive contextual information about a property's surrounding area.
- **Topic Role:** The Agentforce agent should act as a neighborhood expert, providing users with detailed information about the area surrounding a property. The agent should efficiently retrieve and present information from external APIs to help users understand the context of a property.
- **Instructions:**
    - The agent should be able to understand user requests for neighborhood information, commute and location analytics, and walkability and amenity scores.
    - The agent should be able to interact with the API Integration Layer to retrieve data from external APIs.
    - The agent should present the retrieved information to the user in a clear and organized manner through the Experience Cloud interface.
    - The agent should handle cases where API calls fail or when information is not available for a specific location.
