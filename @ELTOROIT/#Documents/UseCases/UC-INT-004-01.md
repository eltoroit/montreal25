**UC-INT-004-01: Proactive Communication System**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-004-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on implementing a proactive communication system for internal users (Dreamhouse employees) within the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes sending contextual meeting reminders, generating and distributing offer notifications, and providing daily and weekly listing summaries. The goal is to improve communication efficiency, ensure timely information delivery, and enhance collaboration among employees.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Salesforce data related to meetings, offers, and property listings must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database. This may involve standard objects (e.g., `Event`, `Opportunity`, `Property__c`) or custom objects.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with Salesforce automation and notification functionalities.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can receive and manage notifications.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  The Dreamhouse Agent system or Salesforce automation triggers a communication event (e.g., a scheduled meeting is approaching, an offer is received, a new listing is available).
2.  The Agentforce agent is invoked to handle the communication task.
3.  The agent retrieves the relevant information from Salesforce.
    - For meeting reminders, the agent retrieves event details from the `Event` object.
    - For offer notifications, the agent retrieves offer details from the `Opportunity` object.
    - For listing summaries, the agent retrieves property details from the `Property__c` object.
4.  The Agentforce agent formats a notification message or summary.
5.  The Agentforce agent sends the notification or summary to the appropriate internal user(s) through the Salesforce Slack App.
6.  The user receives the notification or summary within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **No Data Available:** If there is no data to support a notification (e.g., no meetings scheduled, no new offers), the agent may skip sending a notification or provide a message indicating that no relevant information is available.
- **User Preferences:** The system may allow users to configure their notification preferences (e.g., frequency, types of notifications). The agent would need to respect these preferences.
- **Delivery Failure:** If a notification cannot be delivered through Slack, the agent may log the failure and attempt to use an alternative delivery method (if available).
- **Notification Escalation:** In some cases, notifications may need to be escalated to a manager or other personnel if they are not acknowledged or if they are urgent.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect message formatting, missing information) are logged.
- **Slack API Errors:** Errors related to sending notifications through the Slack API are handled, and error messages are logged.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving data from Salesforce are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent, although this use case is primarily for _proactive_ notifications:

1.  "Remind me about my meetings for today."
2.  "What are my upcoming meetings this week?"
3.  "Notify me when a new offer is received on property 123."
4.  "Send me the daily listing summary at 9 AM."
5.  "Can I customize my notification preferences?"
6.  "Show me the offer notifications for this client."
7.  "Get me the weekly listing summary."
8.  "Am I scheduled for any property tours today?"
9.  "Notify me if the offer status changes."
10. "Send me reminders for all my appointments."
11. "What are the details of the next meeting with this client?"
12. "Can I see a history of offer notifications for this property?"
13. "Remind me 30 minutes before each meeting."
14. "Notify me when a property matching my client's criteria is listed."
15. "Can I set up daily notifications for new listings?"
16. "Show me the notification settings."
17. "What are the notification options for offer updates?"
18. "Can I get a weekly summary of my scheduled tours?"
19. "Notify me if any of my clients submit a new offer."
20. "Can I see a report of all my sent notifications?"
21. "Show me all the meeting reminders for today."
22. "Get me the daily summary of new properties."
