**UC-INT-005-01: Data Privacy and Security Management**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-005-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on ensuring data privacy and security management for internal users (Dreamhouse employees) within the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes implementing data masking, ensuring regulatory compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and managing audit logging and access controls. The goal is to protect sensitive data, comply with legal requirements, and maintain a secure and trustworthy system.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Salesforce must be configured with appropriate security settings, including field-level security, sharing settings, and data masking capabilities.
- Audit logging must be enabled within Salesforce.
- Agentforce must be configured to enforce data access controls.
- Internal policies and procedures regarding data privacy and security must be defined and documented.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent system through the Salesforce Slack App.
2.  The Agentforce agent and Salesforce security mechanisms enforce data access controls based on the user's roles and permissions.
3.  Sensitive data is masked to protect user privacy.
4.  All user interactions and data access events are logged for auditing purposes.
5.  The system ensures compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Unauthorized Access Attempt:** If a user attempts to access data they are not authorized to view, the system denies the request and logs the attempt.
- **Data Masking Disabled:** If data masking is not enabled for a particular field, the system displays a warning message and logs the event.
- **Audit Logging Failure:** If audit logging fails, the system generates an error message and alerts administrators.
- **Compliance Violation:** If a user action violates data privacy regulations, the system prevents the action and logs the violation.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce related to security settings, data masking, or audit logging are caught and logged.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic related to enforcing data access controls are logged.
- **Data Masking Errors:** Errors that occur during the data masking process are handled, and error messages are logged.
- **Audit Logging Errors:** Errors related to logging user actions and data access events are handled, and error messages are logged.
- **Security Configuration Errors:** Errors related to the configuration of Salesforce security settings are logged.

**Sample Utterances:**

Since this use case primarily deals with automated security and compliance measures, user utterances are less directly applicable. However, here are some examples of utterances that administrators or auditors might use to check or manage these features:

1.  "Show me the audit log for user John Doe."
2.  "What are the data masking settings for the Contact object?"
3.  "Verify that GDPR compliance is enabled."
4.  "Show me all users with access to sensitive client data."
5.  "Generate a report of all data access violations."
6.  "What are the current data retention policies?"
7.  "Show me the history of changes to data privacy settings."
8.  "Verify that CCPA compliance is enabled."
9.  "Show me the data access controls for the Property object."
10. "Generate a report of all masked data fields."
11. "What are the security settings for the API integration?"
12. "Show me the list of users who have granted consent for data processing."
13. "Verify that data encryption is enabled for all sensitive data."
14. "Show me the audit log for data exports."
15. "What are the procedures for handling data breaches?"
16. "Show me the list of users with administrator privileges."
17. "Verify that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all users."
18. "Show me the audit log for login attempts."
19. "What are the password complexity requirements?"
20. "Show me the settings for field-level security on the Contact object."
21. "Get me the audit logs related to data masking."
22. "Show me the compliance report for CCPA."

**Agentforce Topic:**

- **Topic Summary:** Data Privacy and Security Management
- **Topic Description:** This topic covers the functionality for implementing data masking, ensuring regulatory compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and managing audit logging and access controls. It focuses on protecting sensitive data and maintaining a secure system.
