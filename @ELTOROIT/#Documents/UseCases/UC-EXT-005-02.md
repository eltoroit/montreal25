**UC-EXT-005-02: Financial Planning Support**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-005-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with financial planning support through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes mortgage rate and eligibility calculations, predictive financial modeling, and address validation and preliminary assessment. The goal is to assist customers in evaluating their financial readiness for property transactions and provide them with relevant financial insights.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Salesforce must be configured to store or access data necessary for mortgage calculations, financial modeling, and property assessments.
- API Integration Layer must be configured to connect to external APIs or data sources that provide mortgage rates, financial data, and property assessment information.
- Agentforce must be configured to retrieve and present this information to users through the Experience Cloud interface.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to request financial planning support.
2.  The user provides input related to their financial situation or property of interest.
3.  The Agentforce agent retrieves the necessary data from Salesforce or external APIs.
4.  The Agentforce agent performs the requested calculations, modeling, or assessments.
5.  The Agentforce agent presents the results to the user through the Experience Cloud interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Insufficient Data:** If the user provides insufficient data for calculations or modeling, the agent prompts the user for additional information.
- **API Call Failure:** If an API call to an external service fails, the agent handles the error gracefully and informs the user that the requested information could not be retrieved.
- **Invalid Input:** If the user provides invalid input, the agent informs the user and requests correct input.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **API Errors:** Errors returned by external APIs are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Calculation Errors:** Errors that occur during mortgage calculations or financial modeling are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving data from Salesforce or external APIs are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for financial planning support:
