**UC-INT-003-01: Comprehensive Salesforce Data Integration**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-003-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on enabling internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to leverage the full power of the Salesforce platform by providing comprehensive data integration capabilities. This includes cross-object query capabilities and the ability to retrieve and correlate data from various Salesforce objects such as opportunities, contacts, tasks, and cases. It also encompasses advanced property and broker information retrieval. The goal is to provide a unified view of information within Salesforce, allowing employees to make informed decisions, improve efficiency, and enhance overall productivity.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Salesforce data must be structured and accessible within the relevant Salesforce objects (e.g., `Opportunity`, `Contact`, `Task`, `Case`, `Property__c`, `Broker__c`).
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the Salesforce data model to allow for cross-object queries and data retrieval.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and retrieve Salesforce data.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to retrieve and correlate data from various Salesforce objects.
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent interprets the user's request and orchestrates the necessary actions.
4.  The agent interacts with the Salesforce platform to retrieve the requested data. This may involve:
    - Performing SOQL queries to retrieve data from one or more Salesforce objects.
    - Using Salesforce APIs to access and retrieve data.
    - Correlating data from different objects based on relationships between them.
5.  The Agentforce agent gathers the requested information.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response, providing the requested data in a clear and concise manner, and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Object Not Found:** If the user requests data from a Salesforce object that does not exist, the agent provides an appropriate message indicating that the object could not be found.
- **Invalid Query:** If the user provides an invalid query or requests data in a way that is not supported, the agent prompts the user to revise their request.
- **No Matching Records:** If the query returns no matching records, the agent informs the user that no data was found based on the provided criteria.
- **Data Access Error:** If the user attempts to access data they are not authorized to view, the agent denies the request and informs the user of their insufficient privileges.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.
- **Partial Results:** If a query returns a large number of records, the agent may provide a subset of the results and offer options to refine the query or retrieve additional data.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **SOQL Query Errors:** Errors related to the execution of SOQL queries are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for comprehensive Salesforce data integration:

1.  "Show me all opportunities related to client John Smith."
2.  "What are the open tasks for broker Jane Doe?"
3.  "Retrieve all cases associated with property 123 Main St."
4.  "Show me the contact details for the lead agent on opportunity XYZ."
5.  "What is the latest activity on account ABC Corporation?"
6.  "Retrieve all tasks due this week across all brokers."
7.  "Show me a list of all properties with their associated brokers."
8.  "What are the recent updates on opportunity 456?"
9.  "Retrieve all contacts related to this case."
10. "Show me all the opportunities created this month."
11. "What are the upcoming events scheduled for this client?"
12. "Retrieve a list of all properties sold by broker X."
13. "Show me the contact information for the property manager."
14. "What is the status of the current task for this client?"
15. "Retrieve all the notes related to this opportunity."
16. "Show me the history of changes made to this property record."
17. "What are the details of the last call with this contact?"

22. "Show me all the interactions with this client across all departments."
