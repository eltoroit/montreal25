**UC-EXT-005-01: Neighborhood and Lifestyle Analytics**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-005-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with neighborhood and lifestyle analytics through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes retrieving detailed school and community ratings, comparing neighborhood amenities, and providing contextual location insights. The goal is to offer customers valuable information about different neighborhoods to help them make informed decisions about where to live.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Salesforce must be configured to store or access neighborhood data, including school ratings, community information, and amenity details.
- API Integration Layer must be configured to connect to external APIs or data sources that provide neighborhood and lifestyle analytics.
- Agentforce must be configured to retrieve and present this information to users through the Experience Cloud interface.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to request neighborhood and lifestyle analytics.
2.  The user specifies a neighborhood or location for which they want to retrieve information.
3.  The Agentforce agent retrieves the requested information from Salesforce or external APIs.
4.  The Agentforce agent presents the retrieved information to the user through the Experience Cloud interface.
5.  The user can view details about school ratings, community information, neighborhood amenities, and other relevant location insights.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Information Not Available:** If specific neighborhood or lifestyle information is not available, the agent informs the user and suggests alternative data sources.
- **API Call Failure:** If an API call to an external service fails, the agent handles the error gracefully and informs the user that the requested information could not be retrieved.
- **Partial Information:** If only partial information is available, the agent presents the available data to the user.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **API Errors:** Errors returned by external APIs are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving data from Salesforce or external APIs are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for neighborhood and lifestyle analytics:

1.  "What are the school ratings for this neighborhood?"
2.  "Show me the community information for this area."
3.  "What are the nearby amenities?"
4.  "Compare the neighborhood amenities of these two locations."
