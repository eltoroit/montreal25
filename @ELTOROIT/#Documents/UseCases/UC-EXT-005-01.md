# UC-EXT-005-01: Neighborhood and Lifestyle Analytics

## Purpose:

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with neighborhood and lifestyle analytics through the Dreamhouse Agent system.

2.  **Gather Comprehensive Neighborhood Data**:

    - Retrieve detailed information on the specified location, including school ratings, community demographics, crime rates, nearby amenities, walkability score, transportation, commute times, local restaurants and shopping, community events, healthcare facilities, housing trends, lifestyle information, and future development plans.

3.  **Enable Neighborhood Comparison**:

    - Allow users to compare amenities and characteristics across multiple neighborhoods.
