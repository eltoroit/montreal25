**UC-INT-003-02: Advanced Reporting and Analytics**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-003-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing internal users (Dreamhouse employees) with advanced reporting and analytics capabilities within the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes generating property permit and tax reports, as well as creating detailed broker performance insights. The goal is to empower employees with data-driven insights to improve decision-making, optimize operations, and enhance overall business performance.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Salesforce data relevant to property permits, taxes, and broker performance must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database. This may involve standard objects or custom objects.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with Salesforce reporting and analytics functionalities.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and generate reports.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to generate a report or access analytics related to property permits, taxes, or broker performance.
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent interprets the user's request and orchestrates the necessary actions.
4.  The agent interacts with the Salesforce platform to generate the requested report or retrieve the relevant analytics. This may involve:
    - Running pre-built Salesforce reports.
    - Creating custom reports using SOQL queries.
    - Accessing and processing data from Salesforce dashboards.
    - Performing calculations and aggregations on Salesforce data.
5.  The Agentforce agent gathers the requested information.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response, providing the requested report or analytics in a clear and concise manner, and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Report Not Found:** If the user requests a report that does not exist, the agent provides an appropriate message indicating that the report could not be found.
- **Invalid Report Request:** If the user provides an invalid report request or requests data in a way that is not supported, the agent prompts the user to revise their request.
- **No Data Available:** If the report returns no data based on the specified criteria, the agent informs the user that no data was found.
- **Data Access Error:** If the user attempts to access data or generate reports they are not authorized to view, the agent denies the request and informs the user of their insufficient privileges.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.
- **Partial Results:** If a report returns a large amount of data, the agent may provide a summary or a subset of the results and offer options to refine the report or retrieve additional data.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions, report generation errors) are caught and logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **Report Generation Errors:** Errors related to the generation of reports are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for advanced reporting and analytics:

1.  "Generate a property permit report for address 123 Main St."
