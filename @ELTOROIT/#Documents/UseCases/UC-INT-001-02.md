# UC-INT-001-02: Access and Interpret Listing Guidelines

## Purpose:

This use case focuses on enabling internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to efficiently access and interpret property listing guidelines. It leverages the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capability, using Salesforce Data Cloud and Einstein Data Libraries, to retrieve listing requirements from documents such as "Dreamhouse Property Listing Guidelines & General Terms" . This ensures that employees can easily understand and comply with internal rules and regulations related to property listings, promoting consistency and accuracy in the listing process.
