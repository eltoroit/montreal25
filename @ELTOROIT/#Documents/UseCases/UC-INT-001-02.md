**UC-INT-001-02: Access and Interpret Listing Guidelines**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-001-02

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on enabling internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to efficiently access and interpret property listing guidelines. It leverages the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capability, using Salesforce Data Cloud and Einstein Data Libraries, to retrieve listing requirements from documents such as "Dreamhouse Property Listing Guidelines & General Terms" . This ensures that employees can easily understand and comply with internal rules and regulations related to property listings, promoting consistency and accuracy in the listing process.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- The "Dreamhouse Property Listing Guidelines & General Terms" document (or similar documents containing the guidelines) must be ingested and indexed within Salesforce Data Cloud and Einstein Data Libraries for RAG processing .
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the RAG engine to facilitate information retrieval based on user queries.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and query the listing guidelines.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to access or interpret property listing guidelines.
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent recognizes the need to access listing guidelines and interacts with the RAG engine.
4.  The RAG engine processes the user's query and retrieves relevant information from the indexed documents in Salesforce Data Cloud and Einstein Data Libraries .
5.  The Agentforce agent receives the retrieved information from the RAG engine.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response, providing the requested listing guidelines or interpretations, and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **No Matching Guidelines:** If the RAG engine cannot find information relevant to the user's query, the agent provides a message indicating that no matching guidelines were found. The agent might suggest alternative search terms or provide general guidance.
- **Ambiguous Query:** If the user's query is ambiguous, the agent may ask clarifying questions to ensure accurate retrieval of information from the listing guidelines.
- **Partial Information:** If the RAG engine retrieves only partial information, the agent informs the user and provides the available information, indicating that complete details may require further review of the source document.
- **RAG Engine Error:** If the RAG engine encounters an error, the agent handles the error gracefully and informs the user that the requested information could not be retrieved. The agent may suggest trying again later.
- **Document Update Required:** If the agent identifies that the information requested is outdated, it should inform the user and flag the document for review.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **RAG Engine Errors:** Errors occurring during the RAG process are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Data Cloud/Einstein Data Libraries Errors:** Errors related to accessing or querying data within Data Cloud or Einstein Data Libraries are caught and logged.
- **Invalid Input:** If the user provides invalid input, the agent prompts the user to provide correct information.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent to access and interpret listing guidelines:
