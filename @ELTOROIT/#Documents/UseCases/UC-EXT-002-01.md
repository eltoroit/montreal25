**UC-EXT-002-01: Intelligent Tour Scheduling**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-002-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with intelligent tour scheduling capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes flexible tour booking and rescheduling, real-time availability tracking, and adaptive scheduling based on user preferences. The goal is to enable customers to easily and efficiently schedule property tours according to their convenience and preferences.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Property data, including tour availability and scheduling information, must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the necessary data sources and scheduling functionalities to facilitate tour booking, rescheduling, and availability tracking.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to schedule a property tour.
2.  The user selects a property they wish to tour and indicates their preferred dates and times.
3.  The Agentforce agent checks the real-time availability of the property and schedules.
4.  The agent confirms the tour schedule with the user, providing details such as date, time, and property address.
5.  The system allows for flexible tour rescheduling or cancellation by the user.
6.  The agent updates the tour schedule and notifies the relevant parties (e.g., the user, the listing agent).

**Alternative Flows:**

- **No Availability:** If there is no availability for the user's preferred dates and times, the agent suggests alternative options or prompts the user to select different times.
- **Scheduling Conflict:** If there is a scheduling conflict (e.g., the property is already booked), the agent informs the user and provides alternative time slots.
- **Rescheduling Request:** If the user requests to reschedule a tour, the agent checks availability and updates the schedule accordingly.
- **Cancellation Request:** If the user requests to cancel a tour, the agent processes the cancellation and notifies the relevant parties.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **Scheduling Errors:** Errors related to tour scheduling, rescheduling, or cancellation are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving property or availability data are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for intelligent tour scheduling:

1.  "Schedule a tour for 123 Main St."
2.  "I want to book a tour for this Saturday."
3.  "What are the available tour times for this property?"
4.  "Can I schedule a tour for tomorrow at 2 PM?"
