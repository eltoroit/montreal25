**UC-INT-001-01: Comprehensive Property Lifecycle Management**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-001-01

**Purpose:**

This use case outlines the functionalities for internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to effectively manage the entire lifecycle of property listings within the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes retrieving and managing new listings, tracking price changes, managing property summaries, and monitoring and scheduling open houses. The goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for employees to maintain accurate and up-to-date property information, ensuring efficient operations and better service delivery.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Property data must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database, specifically within the `Property__c` object.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the necessary data sources and APIs.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and modify property information.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to perform a property management task (e.g., retrieve new listings, update a price).
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent interprets the user's request and orchestrates the necessary actions.
4.  The agent may interact with various Salesforce components and external APIs to fulfill the request.
    - For retrieving new listings, the agent queries the `Property__c` object.
    - For tracking price changes, the agent updates the price field in the `Property__c` object.
    - For managing property summaries, the agent retrieves or updates relevant fields in the `Property__c` object.
    - For monitoring and scheduling open houses, the agent may interact with scheduling functionalities within Salesforce or an integrated calendar API.
5.  The Agentforce agent gathers the requested information or performs the requested action.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information or confirmation of the action within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **No Matching Records:** If the user requests information about a property that does not exist, the agent provides an appropriate message indicating that no matching records were found.
- **Invalid Input:** If the user provides invalid input (e.g., incorrect property ID, invalid date format), the agent prompts the user to correct their input.
- **API Errors:** If an error occurs while interacting with an external API (e.g., Walk Score API), the agent handles the error gracefully and informs the user that the requested information could not be retrieved.
- **Authorization Failure:** If the user attempts to perform an action they are not authorized to perform, the agent denies the request and informs the user of their insufficient privileges.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.
- **Partial Results:** If a request returns only a subset of the expected results, the agent informs the user and provides the available information.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **API Errors:** Errors returned by external APIs are handled based on the specific error code and message. Retry mechanisms may be implemented for transient errors.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **Data Validation Errors:** If the user attempts to input invalid data (e.g., a price in an incorrect format), the agent provides an error message and prompts for correct input.
- **RAG Engine Errors:** If the RAG engine fails to retrieve information, the agent should provide a fallback response to the user.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for property lifecycle management:

1.  "Show me the new property listings for today."
2.  "What are the details for property ID 12345?"
3.  "Has the price changed for 456 Oak Street?"
4.  "Update the price of 789 Pine Lane to $550,000."
5.  "Can you give me a summary of 101 Elm Street?"
6.  "When is the next open house for 222 Maple Avenue?"
7.  "Schedule an open house for 333 Cedar Road next Saturday."
8.  "What is the current status of listing 567 Willow Court?"
9.  "Retrieve all active listings in the downtown area."
10. "Show me properties with at least 3 bedrooms."
11. "What's the average price of properties in this zip code?"
12. "List the most recent price changes for the past week."
13. "Send me a daily summary of new listings."
14. "I need to see the property summary for listing number 890."
15. "Please update the property description for listing 1122."
16. "Can you tell me if there are any open houses scheduled for this weekend?"
17. "What is the listing price history for 1212 Main Street?"
18. "Show me the properties that have had a price reduction in the last month."
19. "I want to see all the details related to property 1313."
20. "What are the upcoming open house dates for properties in my area?"
21. "Get the latest updates on new listings."
22. "Show me the properties that match these criteria..." (and then provide criteria)
