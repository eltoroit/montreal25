**UC-INT-002-01: Holistic Client Information Tracking**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-002-01

**Purpose:**

This use case outlines the functionalities for internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to effectively track client information within the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes retrieving and consolidating client inquiries, managing contact details, tracking offer statuses, and automating personalized follow-up reminders. The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of client interactions and information, enabling employees to provide personalized and efficient service, ultimately fostering stronger client relationships.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Client data must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database, specifically within the `Contact` object, and related objects such as `Opportunity` and `Case`.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the necessary data sources and Salesforce objects.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and modify client information.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to perform a client information tracking task (e.g., retrieve client details, update contact information).
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent interprets the user's request and orchestrates the necessary actions.
4.  The agent interacts with various Salesforce components to fulfill the request.
    - For retrieving client inquiries, the agent queries relevant objects like `Case` and `Contact`.
    - For managing contact details, the agent retrieves or updates fields in the `Contact` object.
    - For tracking offer statuses, the agent retrieves information from the `Opportunity` object.
    - For automating personalized follow-up reminders, the agent may interact with Salesforce automation tools or scheduling functionalities.
5.  The Agentforce agent gathers the requested information or performs the requested action.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information or confirmation of the action within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Client Not Found:** If the user requests information about a client that does not exist, the agent provides an appropriate message indicating that no matching records were found.
- **Invalid Input:** If the user provides invalid input (e.g., incorrect client ID, invalid data format), the agent prompts the user to correct their input.
- **Data Access Error:** If the user attempts to access client information they are not authorized to view, the agent denies the request and informs the user of their insufficient privileges.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.
- **Partial Information:** If a request returns only a subset of the expected results, the agent informs the user and provides the available information.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **Data Validation Errors:** If the user attempts to input invalid data (e.g., a phone number in an incorrect format), the agent provides an error message and prompts for correct input.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for client information tracking:

1.  "Show me the latest inquiries for client John Smith."
2.  "What is the contact information for Jane Doe?"
3.  "Update the phone number for Robert Jones to 555-123-4567."
4.  "What is the current status of the offer for client Sarah Lee?"
5.  "Schedule a follow-up reminder for client David Kim for next week."
6.  "Retrieve all the contact details for client company Acme Corp."
7.  "What are the open cases for client Michael Brown?"
8.  "Show me a summary of interactions with client Emily Wilson."
9.  "What is the client's preferred method of contact?"
10. "Has client Chris Evans responded to our last email?"
11. "What is the offer history for client Jessica Garcia?"
12. "Remind me to follow up with client Ashley Perez in three days."
13. "Get me the mailing address for client Brian Rodriguez."
14. "What is the current offer amount for client Kevin Williams?"
15. "Show me all notes related to client Nicole Anderson."
16. "What is the client's current property interest?"
