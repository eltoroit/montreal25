**UC-INT-002-02: Client Financial and Preference Analysis**

**Identifier:** UC-INT-002-02

**Purpose:**

This use case outlines the functionalities for internal users (Dreamhouse employees) to retrieve and analyze client requirements, assess financial information, and generate client interaction insights. This enables employees to gain a deeper understanding of each client's needs and financial capabilities, allowing for more personalized and effective service delivery, ultimately increasing client satisfaction and sales conversion rates.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to internal users through the Salesforce Slack App.
- Client data, including requirements and financial information, must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database, potentially within the `Contact` object and related objects like `Opportunity` and custom objects for financial details.
- Agentforce must be configured and integrated with the necessary data sources and Salesforce objects.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure that only authorized employees can access and analyze client information.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An internal user initiates a request through the Salesforce Slack App to analyze client financial information or preferences.
2.  The Slack App relays the user's request to the Agentforce agent.
3.  The Agentforce agent interprets the user's request and orchestrates the necessary actions.
4.  The agent interacts with various Salesforce components to fulfill the request.
    - For retrieving and analyzing client requirements, the agent queries relevant fields in the `Contact` object or related objects where client preferences are stored.
    - For assessing financial information, the agent retrieves data from fields related to income, pre-approval amounts, or other financial details, potentially in custom objects.
    - For generating client interaction insights, the agent may analyze data from various objects like `Contact`, `Case`, and `Opportunity` to identify patterns and trends.
5.  The Agentforce agent gathers the requested information and performs the necessary analysis.
6.  The Agentforce agent formats a response, providing the requested client analysis or insights, and sends it back to the user through the Salesforce Slack App.
7.  The user receives the requested information within the Slack interface.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Client Not Found:** If the user requests information about a client that does not exist, the agent provides an appropriate message indicating that no matching records were found.
- **Insufficient Data:** If there is insufficient client data to perform the requested analysis, the agent informs the user and provides any available information.
- **Invalid Input:** If the user provides invalid input or requests an analysis that cannot be performed, the agent prompts the user to correct their input or clarifies the available analysis options.
- **Data Access Error:** If the user attempts to access client financial information they are not authorized to view, the agent denies the request and informs the user of their insufficient privileges.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce (e.g., SOQL query errors, Apex exceptions) are caught and logged, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.
- **Agentforce Errors:** Errors within the Agentforce agent's logic (e.g., incorrect dialog flow, missing information) are logged for debugging and improvement.
- **Data Calculation Errors:** If errors occur during the calculation or analysis of client financial information, the agent handles the error and provides an informative error message.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an internal user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for client financial and preference analysis:

1.  "What are John Smith's property requirements?"
2.  "Show me Jane Doe's pre-approved loan amount."
