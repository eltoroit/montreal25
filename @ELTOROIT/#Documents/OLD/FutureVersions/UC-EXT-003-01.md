**UC-EXT-003-01: Secure Document Access and Verification**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-003-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with secure document access and verification capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes allowing users to access and download contracts and lease agreements, verifying document authenticity, and providing clarification and interpretation support. The goal is to provide a secure and transparent way for customers to interact with important documents related to their property transactions.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Contracts, lease agreements, and other relevant documents must be stored and accessible within the Salesforce database.
- Agentforce must be configured to provide secure access to these documents and support document verification and clarification.
- Security measures must be in place to ensure document authenticity and prevent unauthorized access.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to access or verify documents.
2.  The user requests access to a specific document, such as a contract or lease agreement.
3.  The Agentforce agent retrieves the requested document from the Salesforce database and provides it to the user through the Experience Cloud interface.
4.  The user can view and download the document.
5.  If the user requests document verification, the Agentforce agent may provide information or mechanisms to help verify the document's authenticity.
6.  If the user requests clarification or interpretation support, the Agentforce agent provides assistance or connects the user with a human agent.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Document Not Found:** If the requested document is not found, the agent informs the user and provides appropriate alternatives or instructions.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If a user attempts to access a document they are not authorized to view, the system denies access and provides an error message.
- **Verification Failed:** If document verification fails, the agent informs the user and provides further instructions or support.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **Document Access Errors:** Errors related to retrieving or providing access to documents are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Security Errors:** Errors related to unauthorized access attempts or document security are logged and handled appropriately.
- **Verification Errors:** Errors that occur during document verification are handled, and appropriate error messages are provided.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for secure document access and verification:

1.  "Can I access my lease agreement?"
2.  "Show me the contract for this property."
3.  "Where can I download the purchase agreement?"
