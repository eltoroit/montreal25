    - Check Tour Availability: Query Salesforce for real-time availability.
    - Display Available Tour Dates and Times: Show available dates and alternative times if needed.
    - Handle Scheduling Conflicts: Notify the user and offer alternatives in case of conflicts.

3.  **Manage and Confirm Tour Bookings**:

    - Book Tour: Create a booking record in Salesforce if the time is available.
    - Confirm Tour Booking: Send confirmation details to relevant parties.
    - Handle Rescheduling and Cancellation: Update booking records and notify parties as needed.
