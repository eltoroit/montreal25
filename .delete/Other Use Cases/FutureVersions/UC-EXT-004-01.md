**UC-EXT-004-01: End-to-End Transaction Monitoring**

**Identifier:** UC-EXT-004-01

**Purpose:**

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with end-to-end transaction monitoring capabilities through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes real-time offer and closing status tracking, mortgage and loan status updates, and integrated financial eligibility assessments. The goal is to provide customers with comprehensive visibility into their property transactions and related financial processes.

**Preconditions:**

- The Dreamhouse Agent system must be operational and accessible to external users through the Salesforce Experience Cloud.
- Salesforce must be configured to store and track offer details, closing status, mortgage/loan information, and financial eligibility data.
- Agentforce must be configured to access and present this information to external users.

**Basic Flow:**

1.  An external user interacts with the Dreamhouse Agent through the Salesforce Experience Cloud interface to monitor their transaction.
2.  The user requests information about the status of their offer, closing, mortgage, or loan.
3.  The Agentforce agent retrieves the requested information from Salesforce.
4.  The Agentforce agent presents the information to the user through the Experience Cloud interface.
5.  If financial eligibility assessments are integrated, the Agentforce agent may provide updates or information related to these assessments.

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Information Not Available:** If specific information is not available (e.g., loan status is pending), the agent informs the user and provides available details.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If a user attempts to access information they are not authorized to view, the system denies access and provides an error message.
- **System Unavailable:** If the Salesforce platform or a specific component is temporarily unavailable, the agent informs the user of the issue and suggests trying again later.

**Error Flows:**

- **Salesforce Errors:** Errors occurring within Salesforce or Agentforce are logged.
- **Data Retrieval Errors:** Errors that occur while retrieving transaction or financial data are handled, and informative error messages are provided to the user.
- **Security Errors:** Errors related to unauthorized access attempts are logged and handled appropriately.

**Sample Utterances:**

Here are 20+ sample utterances that an external user might use when interacting with the Agentforce agent for end-to-end transaction monitoring:

1.  "What is the current status of my offer?"
2.  "When is my closing scheduled?"
3.  "What are the latest updates on my loan application?"
4.  "Is my mortgage pre-approval still valid?"
5.  "Show me the timeline for the closing process."
6.  "What are the next steps in the transaction?"
7.  "Has my offer been accepted?"
8.  "What is the status of my escrow account?"
9.  "Are there any updates on my mortgage rate lock?"
10. "When will I receive the closing documents?"
11. "What are the contingencies on my offer?"
12. "Show me the progress of my loan processing."
13. "What are the fees associated with closing?"
14. "Is there any action needed from my side?"
15. "What are the key dates in the transaction?"
16. "Show me the details of my financial eligibility assessment."
17. "What is the status of my appraisal?"
18. "When will the funds be disbursed?"
19. "Give me an update on my offer."
