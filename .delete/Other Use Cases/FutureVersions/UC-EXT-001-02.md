# UC-EXT-001-02: Contextual Property Insights

## Purpose:

This use case focuses on providing external users (Dreamhouse customers) with contextual property insights through the Dreamhouse Agent system. This includes retrieving neighborhood information, accessing commute and location analytics, and providing walkability and amenity scores. The goal is to offer customers comprehensive information about the surrounding area to help them make informed decisions about properties.

## What can the agent do?

1.  **Gather Comprehensive Location Data via APIs**:

    - Retrieve Walk Score, Transit Score, and Bike Score.
    - Obtain Neighborhood Information (demographics, crime rate, schools).
    - Calculate Commute Times to specified locations.
    - Access Nearby Amenities Information (grocery stores, restaurants, parks).
    - Retrieve Location Analytics (market trends, property values).
